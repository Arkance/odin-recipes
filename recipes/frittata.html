    <p>This easy zucchini and halloumi frittata is flavored with fresh herbs.<br/>
        To make a frittata for 4, simply double the ingredients and use a larger frying pan.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p><ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li> 
            <li>1 large zucchini, grated and squeezed dry</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>4 ounces halloumi cheese, sliced</li>
        </ul></p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a small, ovenproof skillet over medium heat.<br/>
                Add zucchini and a pinch of salt and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. <br/>
                Add chopped mint and dill, and cook 1 minute more.</li>
            <li>Beat eggs with salt and pepper in a small bowl. Pour into the hot skillet with the zucchini and briefly stir. <br/>
                Cook without stirring to allow the bottom of the frittata to set, about 2 minutes. <br/>
                Use a spatula around the edges of the skillet to ensure that the frittata isn't sticking as the bottom starts to set.
            </li>
            <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
            <li>Lay the slices of halloumi on the top of the frittata as the edges start to set. <br/>
                Place the skillet under the broiler until the top of the frittata is fully set and cheese is slightly browned, about 5 minutes.<br/> 
                Serve immediately or at room temperature..</li>
        </ol>
